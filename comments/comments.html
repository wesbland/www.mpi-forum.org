<H1>Submitting Comments about MPI Documents</H1>
</CENTER>

<P>When submitting comments, please keep in mind that the MPI Forum only
deals with issues relating to the MPI standard and documents created
by the MPI Forum.  We cannot address issues relating to problems
encountered in MPI implementations unless it deals with interpreting
the MPI standard.  It is especially useful to specify the document,
page, and line number of the text under discussion.  If you are
reporting a problem with one of the documents, you may find it useful
to first check the current <A HREF="../docs/docs.html">errata
documents</A> to see if the problem is already known.  
<p>
