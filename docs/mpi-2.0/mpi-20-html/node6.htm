 MPI-1 used informal naming conventions. In many cases,  MPI-1 names  
for C functions are of the form  Class_action_subset and in  
Fortran of the form  CLASS_ACTION_SUBSET, but this rule is  
not uniformly applied. In  MPI-2, an attempt has been made to  
standardize names of new functions according to the following  
rules. In addition, the C++ bindings for  MPI-1 functions also follow  
these rules (see Section <a href="node21.htm#Node21">C++ Binding Issues 
</a>). C and Fortran function  
names for  MPI-1 have not been changed.  
<P> 
<ol> 
 
1. In C, all routines associated with a particular type of  MPI object  
should be of the form  Class_action_subset or, if no subset  
exists, of the form  Class_action. In Fortran, all routines  
associated with a particular type of  MPI object should be of the form  
 CLASS_ACTION_SUBSET or, if no subset exists, of the form  
 CLASS_ACTION.  For C and Fortran we use the C++ terminology  
to define the  Class.  In C++, the routine is a method on <b>  
Class</b> and is named <b> MPI::Class::Action_subset</b>.  
  
If the routine is associated with a certain class, but  
does not make sense as an object method, it is  
a static member function of the class.   
  
<P> 
 
<BR> 
2. If the routine is not associated with a class, the name  
should be of the form  Action_subset in C and   
 ACTION_SUBSET in Fortran,   
and in C++ should be scoped in the <b> MPI</b> namespace, <b>  
MPI::Action_subset</b>.  
<P> 
 
<BR> 
3. The names of certain actions have been standardized. In   
particular, <b> Create</b> creates a new object, <b> Get</b>  
retrieves information about an object, <b> Set</b> sets  
this information, <b> Delete</b> deletes information,   
<b> Is</b> asks whether or not an object has a certain property.  
<P> 
</ol> 
C and Fortran names for  MPI-1 functions violate these rules  
in several cases. The most common exceptions are the omission  
of the <b> Class</b> name from the routine and the omission of  
the <b> Action</b> where one can be inferred.  
<P> 
 MPI identifiers are limited to 30 characters (31 with the profiling  
interface).  This is done to avoid exceeding the limit on some  
compilation systems.  
<P>
