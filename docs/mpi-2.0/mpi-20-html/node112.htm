A high-quality implementation will allow any  
process (including those not started with a ``parallel  
application'' mechanism) to become an  MPI process by calling  
 MPI_INIT. Such a process can then  
connect to other  MPI processes using the   
 MPI_COMM_ACCEPT and  MPI_COMM_CONNECT  
routines, or spawn other  MPI processes.   MPI does not mandate this  
behavior, but strongly encourages it where technically feasible.  
<P> 
 
<BR> 
<em> Advice  
        to implementors.</em>  
<P> 
To start an  MPI-1 application with more than one process   
requires some special coordination. The processes  
must be started at the ``same'' time, they must   
have a mechanism to establish communication, etc.   
Either the user or the operating system must take special  
steps beyond simply starting processes.   
<P> 
When an application enters  MPI_INIT, clearly  
it must be able to determine if these special steps  
were taken.  MPI-1 does not say what happens if  
these special steps were not taken --- presumably  
this is treated as an error in starting the  
 MPI application.  MPI-2 recommends the following behavior.  
<P> 
If a process enters  MPI_INIT and determines  
that no special steps were taken (i.e., it has not been given  
the information to form an  MPI_COMM_WORLD  
with other processes) it succeeds and forms   
a singleton  MPI program, that is, one in which  
 MPI_COMM_WORLD has size 1.   
<P> 
In some implementations,  MPI may not be able to  
function without an ``MPI environment.'' For example,   
 MPI may require that daemons be running or  MPI  
may not be able to work at all on the front-end  
of an MPP. In this case, an  MPI implementation may   
either  
<ol> 
 
1. Create the environment (e.g., start a daemon) or  
 
<BR> 
2. Raise an error if it cannot create the environment  
and the environment has not been started independently.   
</ol> 
A high quality implementation will try to create  
a singleton  MPI process and not raise an error.
