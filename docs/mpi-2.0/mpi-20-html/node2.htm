Beginning in March 1995, the  MPI Forum began meeting to  
consider corrections and extensions to the original  MPI Standard  
document [<a href="node250.htm#-Bib5">5</a>].  The first product of these deliberations was  
Version 1.1 of the  MPI specification, released in June of 1995 (see <BR>  
  
<tt> http://www.mpi-forum.org</tt> for official  MPI document releases).  
  
Since that time, effort has been focused in five types of areas.  
<ol> 
 
1. Further corrections and clarifications for the  MPI-1.1 document.  
 
<BR> 
2. Additions to  MPI-1.1 that do not significantly change its types of  
  functionality (new datatype constructors, language interoperability, etc.).  
 
<BR> 
3. Completely new types of functionality (dynamic processes, one-sided  
  communication, parallel I/O, etc.) that are what everyone thinks of as  
  ``MPI-2 functionality.''  
  
 
<BR> 
4. Bindings for Fortran 90 and C++.  This document specifies C++ bindings  
  for both  MPI-1 and  MPI-2 functions, and extensions to the Fortran 77  
  binding of  MPI-1 and  MPI-2 to handle Fortran 90 issues.  
  
 
<BR> 
5. Discussions of areas in which the  MPI process and framework seem likely  
  to be useful, but where more discussion and experience are needed before  
  standardization (e.g. 0-copy semantics on shared-memory machines, real-time  
  specifications).  
</ol> 
  
<P> 
Corrections and clarifications (items of type 1 in the above list)  
have been collected in Chapter <a href="node28.htm#Node28">Version 1.2 of MPI 
</a> of this document,  
``Version 1.2 of MPI.''  This chapter also contains the function for  
identifying the version number.  Additions to  MPI-1.1 (items of  
types 2, 3, and 4 in the above list) are in the remaining chapters, and  
constitute the specification for  MPI-2.    
  
This document specifies Version 2.0 of  MPI.  
  
Items of type 5 in the  
above list have been moved to a separate document, the ``MPI Journal  
of Development'' (JOD), and are not part of the  MPI-2 Standard.  
<P> 
This structure makes it easy for users and implementors to understand  
what level of  MPI compliance a given implementation has:  
<ul> 
 
<li> MPI-1 compliance will mean compliance with  MPI-1.2.  
  This is a useful level of compliance.  It means that the  
  implementation conforms to the clarifications of  MPI-1.1 function  
  behavior given in Chapter <a href="node28.htm#Node28">Version 1.2 of MPI 
</a>.  Some  
  implementations may require changes to be  MPI-1 compliant.  
 
<li> MPI-2 compliance will mean compliance with all of  MPI-2.  
 
<li>The  MPI Journal of Development is not part of the  MPI Standard.  
</ul> 
<BR> 
  
<P> 
  
It is to be emphasized that forward compatibility is preserved.  That is,  
a valid  MPI-1.1 program is both a valid  MPI-1.2 program and a valid  
 MPI-2 program, and a valid  MPI-1.2 program is a valid  MPI-2  
program.
