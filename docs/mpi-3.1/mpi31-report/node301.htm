<p>
In a thread-compliant implementation, an <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> process is a process  
that may be multi-threaded.  
Each thread can issue <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> calls; however, threads are not  
separately addressable: a rank in a send or receive call identifies a  
process, not a thread.  A message sent to a process can be received by  
any thread in this process.  
<P> 
 
<br> 
<em> Rationale.</em>  
<P> 
This model corresponds to the POSIX model of interprocess  
communication: the fact that a process is multi-threaded, rather than  
single-threaded, does not affect the external interface of this  
process.    
<font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> implementations in which <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> `processes' are POSIX threads  
inside a single POSIX process are not thread-compliant by this  
definition (indeed, their ``processes'' are single-threaded).  
 (<em> End of rationale.</em>) <br> 
 
<br> 
<em> Advice to users.</em>  
<P> 
It is the user's responsibility to prevent races when threads within the  
same application post conflicting communication calls.  The user can  
make sure that two threads in the same process will not issue  
conflicting communication calls by using distinct communicators at each  
thread.  
 (<em> End of advice to users.</em>) <br> 
The two main requirements for a thread-compliant implementation are listed  
below.  
<ol> 
 
1. All <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> calls are <em> thread-safe</em>,    
i.e.,   
two concurrently  
running threads may make <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> calls and the outcome will be as if the  
calls executed in some order, even if their execution is interleaved.  
 
<br> 
2. Blocking <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> calls will block the calling thread only, allowing  
another thread to execute, if available.  
The calling thread will be blocked until the  
event on which it is waiting occurs.  Once the blocked communication is  
enabled and can proceed, then the call will complete and the thread  
will be marked runnable, within a finite time.  
A blocked thread will not prevent progress of other runnable threads  
on the same process, and will not prevent them from executing <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font>  
calls.  
</ol> 
<br><b> Example</b>  
  
Process 0 consists of two threads.  The first thread  
executes a blocking send call <font face="sans-serif"> MPI_Send(buff1, count, type,  
0, 0, comm)</font>, whereas the second thread executes a blocking receive  
call <font face="sans-serif"> MPI_Recv(buff2, count, type, 0, 0, comm, &amp;status)</font>,  
i.e.,   
the first thread sends a message that is  
received by the second thread.  This communication should always  
succeed.  According to the first requirement, the execution will  
correspond to some interleaving of the two calls.  According to the  
second requirement, a call can only block the calling thread and  
cannot prevent progress of the other thread.  If the send call went  
ahead of the receive call, then the sending thread may block, but this  
will not prevent the receiving thread from executing.  Thus, the  
receive call  
will occur.  Once both calls occur, the communication is enabled  
and both calls will complete.  On the other hand, a  
single-threaded process that posts a send, followed by a matching  
receive, may deadlock.  The progress requirement for multithreaded  
implementations is stronger, as a blocked call cannot prevent progress  
in other threads.  
  
<P> 
 
<br> 
<em> Advice  
        to implementors.</em>  
<P> 
<font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> calls can be made thread-safe by executing only one at a time,  
e.g., by protecting <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> code with one process-global lock.  However,  
blocked  
operations cannot hold the lock, as this would prevent progress of  
other threads in the process.  The  
lock is held only for the duration of an atomic, locally-completing  
suboperation such as posting a send or completing a send, and is released  
in between.  
Finer locks can provide more concurrency, at the expense of higher  
locking overheads.  
Concurrency can also be achieved by having some of the <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> protocol  
executed by separate server threads.
