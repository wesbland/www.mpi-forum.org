<p>
The objective of the <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> profiling interface is to ensure that it is  
relatively easy for authors of profiling (and other similar) tools to  
interface their codes to <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> implementations on different machines.  
<P> 
Since <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> is a machine independent standard with many different  
implementations, it is unreasonable to expect that the authors of  
profiling tools for <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> will have access to the source code   
that    
implements <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> on any particular machine. It is therefore necessary to  
provide a mechanism by which the implementors of such tools can  
collect whatever performance information they wish <em> without</em>  
access to the underlying implementation.  
<P> 
We believe that having such an interface is important if <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> is to be  
attractive to end users, since the availability of many different  
tools will be a significant factor in attracting users to the <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font>  
standard.  
<P> 
The profiling interface is just that, an interface. It says   
<em> nothing</em> about the way in which it is used. There is therefore no  
attempt to lay down what information is collected through the  
interface, or how the collected information is saved, filtered, or  
displayed.  
<P> 
While the initial impetus for the development of this interface arose  
from the desire to permit the implementation of profiling tools, it is  
clear that an interface like that specified may also prove useful for  
other purposes, such as ``internetworking'' multiple <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font>  
implementations. Since all that is defined is an interface, there is  
no objection to its being used wherever it is useful.  
<P> 
As the issues being addressed here are intimately tied up with the way  
in which executable images are built, which may differ greatly on  
different machines, the examples given below should be treated solely  
as one way of implementing the objective of the <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> profiling  
interface. The actual requirements made of an implementation are those  
detailed in the Requirements section above, the whole of the rest of  
this section is only present as justification and discussion of the  
logic for those requirements.  
<P> 
The examples below show one way in which an implementation could be  
constructed to meet the requirements on a Unix system (there are  
doubtless others  
that    
would be equally valid).  
<P>
