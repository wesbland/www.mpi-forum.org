Group constructors are used  
to subset and superset existing groups.  
These constructors construct new groups from existing groups.  
These are local operations, and distinct groups may be defined on  
different processes; a process may also define a group that does not  
include itself.  Consistent definitions are required when groups are  
used as arguments in communicator-building functions.   MPI does not  
provide a mechanism to build a group from scratch, but only from  
other, previously defined groups.  The base group, upon which all  
other groups are defined, is the group associated with the initial  
communicator  MPI_COMM_WORLD (accessible through  
the function  MPI_COMM_GROUP).  
<P> 
 
<BR> 
[]<em> Rationale.</em>  
<P> 
In what follows, there is no group duplication function analogous to  
 MPI_COMM_DUP, defined later in this chapter.  There is no need for  
a group duplicator.  A group, once created, can have several references to it  
by making copies of the handle.  The following constructors address the need  
for subsets and supersets of existing groups.  
 (<em> End of rationale.</em>) <BR> 
 
<BR> 
[]<em> Advice  
 to implementors.</em>  
<P> 
Each group constructor behaves as if it returned a new group object.  
When this new group is a copy of an existing group, then  
one can avoid creating such new objects, using  
a reference-count mechanism.

 The set-like operations are defined as follows:  
<dl> 
 
<dt> 
<b>union</b><dd> 
All elements of the first group ( group1), followed by  
all elements of second group ( group2) not in first.  
 
<dt> 
<b>intersect</b><dd> 
all elements of the first group that are also  
in the second group, ordered as in first group.  
 
<dt> 
<b>difference</b><dd> 
all elements of the first group that are not  
in the second group, ordered as in the first group.  
</dl> 
<BR> 
Note that for these operations the order of processes in the output  
group is determined primarily by order in the first group (if possible)  
and then, if necessary, by order in the second group.  Neither union nor  
intersection are commutative, but both are associative.  
<P> 
The new group can be empty, that is, equal to  
 MPI_GROUP_EMPTY.

The function  MPI_GROUP_INCL creates a group  
 newgroup that consists of the  n processes in  
 group with ranks  rank[0],<IMG SRC="img142.gif">
, rank[n-1];  
the process with rank  i in  
 newgroup is the process with rank  ranks[i] in  
 group.  Each of the  n elements of  ranks must be a  
valid rank in  group and all elements must be distinct, or else the  
program is erroneous.  If  n<I>~=~0</i>, then  newgroup is  
 MPI_GROUP_EMPTY.  
This function can, for instance, be used to reorder the  
elements of a group.  See also  MPI_GROUP_COMPARE.

[  IN   group]  group (handle)

<P> 
The function  MPI_GROUP_EXCL creates a group of processes  
 newgroup that is obtained by deleting from  group  
those processes with ranks  
 ranks[0] ,<IMG SRC="img143.gif">
 ranks[n-1].  
The ordering of processes in  newgroup is identical to the ordering  
in  group.  
Each of the  n elements of  ranks must be a valid  
rank in  group and all elements must be distinct; otherwise, the  
program is erroneous.  
If  n<I>~=~0</i>, then  newgroup is identical to  group.

<BR> 
[  IN   ranges]  an array of integer triplets, of the  
form (first rank, last rank, stride) indicating ranks in  
 group of processes to be included in  newgroup

<P> 
 If   ranges consist of the triplets  
<P><IMG SRC="img144.gif"><P>
then  newgroup consists of the sequence of  
processes in  group with ranks  
<P><IMG SRC="img145.gif"><P>
<P><IMG SRC="img146.gif"><P>
Each computed rank must be a valid  
rank in  group and all computed ranks must be distinct, or else the  
program is erroneous.  
Note that we may have <I>first<SUB>i</SUB> &gt; last<SUB>i</SUB></i>, and <I>stride<SUB>i</SUB></i> may be negative, but  
cannot be zero.  
<P> 
The functionality of this routine is specified to be equivalent to  
expanding the array of ranges to an array of the included ranks and  
passing the resulting array of ranks and other arguments to  
 MPI_GROUP_INCL.  A call to  MPI_GROUP_INCL is  
equivalent to a call to  
 MPI_GROUP_RANGE_INCL with each rank  i

[  IN   ranges]  a one-dimensional  
array of integer triplets of the

 group of processes to be excluded

The functionality of this routine is specified to be equivalent to  
expanding the array of ranges to an array of the excluded ranks and

 MPI_GROUP_EXCL. A call to  MPI_GROUP_EXCL is

<BR> 
[]<em> Advice to users.</em>  
<P> 
The range operations do not explicitly enumerate ranks, and therefore  
are more scalable if implemented efficiently.  Hence, we recommend  MPI programmers  
to use them whenenever possible, as high-quality implementations will  
take advantage of this fact.  
 (<em> End of advice to users.</em>) <BR> 
 
<BR> 
[]<em> Advice  
 to implementors.</em>  
<P> 
The range operations should be implemented, if possible, without  
enumerating the group members,  
in order to obtain better scalability (time and space).
