<P>
 MPI does not specify either the interaction of processes with  
signals, in a UNIX  
environment, or with other events that do not relate to  MPI communication.  
That is, signals are not significant from the view point of  MPI, and  
implementors should attempt to implement  MPI so that signals are  
transparent: an  
 MPI call suspended by a signal should resume and complete after the signal is  
handled.  Generally, the state of a computation that is visible or  
significant from the view-point of  MPI should only be affected by  
 MPI calls.  
<P> 
The intent of  MPI to be thread and signal safe has a number of  
subtle effects.  For example, on Unix systems, a catchable signal such  
as SIGALRM (an alarm signal) must not cause an  MPI routine to behave  
differently than it would have in the absence of the signal.  Of course,  
if the signal handler issues  MPI calls or changes the environment in  
which the  MPI routine is operating (for example, consuming all available  
memory space), the  MPI routine should behave as appropriate for that  
situation (in particular, in this case, the behavior should be the same  
as for a multithreaded  MPI implementation).  
<P> 
A second effect is that a signal handler that performs  MPI calls must  
not interfere with the operation of  MPI.  For example, an  MPI receive of  
any type that occurs within a signal handler must not cause erroneous  
behavior by the  MPI implementation.  Note that an implementation is  
permitted to prohibit the use of  MPI calls from within a signal handler, and  
is not required to detect such use.  
<P> 
It is highly desirable that  MPI not use <tt>SIGALRM</tt>, <tt>SIGFPE</tt>,  
or <tt>SIGIO</tt>.  An implementation is <em> required</em> to  
clearly document all of the signals that the  MPI implementation uses;  
a good place for this information is a Unix `<tt>man</tt>' page on <tt>MPI</tt>.  
<P>
