<P>
The attractiveness of the message-passing paradigm at least partially  
stems from its wide portability.  Programs expressed this way may run  
on distributed-memory  
multiprocessors, networks of workstations, and combinations of all of these.  
In addition, shared-memory implementations are possible.  
The paradigm will not be made obsolete by architectures combining the shared-  
and distributed-memory views, or by increases in network speeds.  It thus  
should be both possible and useful to implement this standard on a great  
variety of machines, including those ``machines" consisting of collections of  
other machines, parallel or not, connected by a communication network.  
<P> 
The interface is suitable for use by fully general MIMD programs, as well as  
those written in the more restricted style of SPMD.  Although no explicit  
support for threads is provided, the interface has been designed so as not to  
prejudice their use.  
With this version of  MPI no support is provided for dynamic spawning  
of tasks.  
<P> 
 MPI provides many features intended to improve performance on  
scalable parallel computers with  
specialized interprocessor communication  
hardware.  Thus, we expect that native, high-performance  
implementations of  MPI will be provided on such machines.  At the  
same time, implementations of  MPI on top of standard Unix  
interprocessor communication protocols will provide portability to  
workstation clusters and heterogenous networks of workstations.  
Several proprietary, native implementations of  MPI, and a public  
domain, portable implementation of  MPI are in progress at the time  
of this writing [<a href="node166.html#-Bib17">17</a>,<a href="node166.html#-Bib13">13</a>].
