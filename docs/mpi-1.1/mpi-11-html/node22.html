An  MPI program consists of autonomous processes, executing  
their own code, in an MIMD style. The codes executed by each process need not be  
identical.  The processes communicate via calls to  MPI communication primitives.  
Typically, each process executes in its own address space, although  
shared-memory implementations of  MPI are possible.  
This document specifies the behavior of a parallel program assuming that only  
 MPI calls are used for communication.  The interaction of an  MPI program with  
other possible means of communication (e.g., shared memory) is not specified.  
<P> 
 MPI does not specify the execution model for each process.  A process can be  
sequential, or can be multi-threaded, with threads possibly executing  
concurrently.  Care has been taken to make  MPI ``thread-safe,'' by  
avoiding  
the use of implicit state.  The desired interaction of  MPI with threads  
is that concurrent threads be all allowed to execute  
 MPI calls, and calls be reentrant;  
a blocking  MPI call blocks only the invoking thread,  
allowing the scheduling of another thread.  
<P> 
 MPI does not provide mechanisms to specify the  
initial allocation of processes to an  MPI computation and their  
binding to physical processors.  
It is expected that vendors will provide mechanisms to do so  
either at load time or at run time.   Such mechanisms will allow the  
specification of the initial number of required processes, the  
code to be executed by each initial process, and the allocation of processes to  
processors.  Also, the current proposal does not provide for dynamic creation or  
deletion of processes during program execution (the total number of processes  
is fixed),  although it is intended to be  
consistent with such extensions.  Finally, we always identify processes  
according to their relative rank in a group, that is,  
consecutive integers in the range <tt> 0..groupsize-1</tt>.
