<P>
The scheme given here does not directly support the nesting of  
profiling functions, since it provides only a single alternative name  
for each  MPI function. Consideration was given to an implementation  
which would allow multiple levels of call interception, however we  
were unable to construct an implementation of this which did not  
have the following disadvantages  
<ul> 
 
<li>assuming a particular implementation language.  
 
<li>imposing a run time cost even when no profiling was taking place.  
</ul> 
<BR> 
Since one of the objectives of  MPI is to permit efficient, low latency  
implementations, and it is not the business of a standard to require a  
particular implementation language, we decided to accept the scheme  
outlined above.  
<P> 
Note, however, that it is possible to use the scheme above to  
implement a multi-level system, since the function called by the user  
may call many different profiling functions before calling the  
underlying  MPI function.  
<P> 
Unfortunately such an implementation may require more cooperation  
between the different profiling libraries than is required for the  
single level implementation detailed above.
