<P>
The following is a list of the remaining chapters in this document, along with  
a brief description of each.  
<P> 
<ul> 
 
<li>Chapter <a href="node8.html#Node8">MPI Terms and Conventions
</a>,  MPI Terms and Conventions,  
explains notational terms and conventions used  
throughout the  MPI document.  
 
<li>Chapter <a href="node28.html#Node28">Point-to-Point Communication
</a>,  Point to Point Communication,  
defines the basic, pairwise communication subset of  MPI.  <em> send</em>  
and <em> receive</em> are found here, along with many associated functions  
designed to make basic communication powerful and efficient.  
 
<li>Chapter <a href="node63.html#Node63">Collective Communication
</a>,  Collective Communications, defines  
process-group collective communication operations.  Well known  
examples of this are barrier and broadcast over a group of processes (not  
necessarily all the processes).  
 
<li>Chapter <a href="node87.html#Node87">Groups, Contexts, and Communicators
</a>,  Groups, Contexts, and Communicators,  
shows how groups of processes are formed and manipulated, how unique  
communication contexts are obtained, and how the two are bound together  
into a <em> communicator</em>.  
 
<li>Chapter <a href="node127.html#Node127">Process Topologies
</a>,  Process Topologies, explains a set  
of utility functions meant to assist in the mapping of process  
groups (a linearly ordered set) to richer topological structures  
such as multi-dimensional grids.  
 
<li>Chapter <a href="node141.html#Node141">MPI Environmental Management
</a>,  MPI Environmental Management, explains  
how the programmer can manage and make inquiries of the current  MPI environment.  
These functions are needed for the writing of correct, robust programs,  
and are especially important for the construction of highly-portable   
message-passing programs.  
 
<li>Chapter <a href="node152.html#Node152">Profiling Interface
</a>,  Profiling Interface, explains a simple   
name-shifting convention that any  MPI implementation must support.  
One motivation for this is the ability to put performance profiling  
calls into  MPI without the need for access to the  MPI source code.  The  
name shift is merely an interface, it says nothing about how the actual  
profiling should be done and in fact, the name shift can   
be useful for other purposes.  
 
<li>Annex <a href="node167.html#Node167">Language Binding
</a>,  Language Bindings,  
gives specific syntax in Fortran 77 and C, for all  MPI functions,   
constants, and types.  
 
<li>The  MPI Function Index is a simple index showing the location of  
the precise definition of each  MPI function, together with both C and  
Fortran bindings.  
</ul>
