<P>
  
<P> 
An initial intra-communicator  MPI_COMM_WORLD of all processes the  
local process can communicate with after initialization (itself included) is  
defined once  MPI_INIT has been called.  In addition,  
the communicator  MPI_COMM_SELF is provided, which includes  
only the process itself.  
<P> 
The predefined constant  
 MPI_COMM_NULL is the value used for invalid communicator handles.  
<P> 
In a static-process-model implementation of  MPI, all processes that  
participate in the computation are available after  MPI is initialized.  For  
this case,  MPI_COMM_WORLD is a communicator of all processes  
available for the computation; this communicator has the same value in all  
processes.  In an implementation of  MPI where processes can dynamically join  
an  MPI execution, it may be the case that a process starts an  MPI computation  
without having access to all other processes.  In such situations,  
 MPI_COMM_WORLD is a communicator incorporating all processes with  
which the joining process can immediately communicate.  Therefore,  
 MPI_COMM_WORLD may simultaneously have different values in different  
processes.  
<P> 
All  MPI implementations are required to provide the  MPI_COMM_WORLD  
communicator.  It cannot be deallocated during the life of a process. The  
group corresponding to this communicator does not appear as a pre-defined  
constant, but it may be accessed using  MPI_COMM_GROUP (see below).  
 MPI does not specify the correspondence between the process rank in  
 MPI_COMM_WORLD and its (machine-dependent) absolute address.  
Neither does  MPI specify the function of the host process, if any.  
Other implementation-dependent, predefined communicators may also be  
provided.
