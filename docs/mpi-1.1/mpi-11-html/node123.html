<P>
In the loosely synchronous model, transfer of control to a <b>  
parallel procedure</b> is effected by having each executing process  
invoke the procedure.  The invocation is a collective operation:  it  
is executed by all processes in the execution group, and invocations  
are similarly ordered at all processes.  However, the invocation need  
not be synchronized.  
<P> 
We say that a parallel procedure is <em> active</em> in a process if the process  
belongs to a group that may collectively execute the procedure, and  
some member of that group is currently executing the procedure code.  
If a parallel procedure is active in a process, then this process may  
be receiving messages pertaining to this procedure, even if it  
does not currently execute the code of this procedure.

<P>
This covers the case where, at any point in time, at most one  
invocation of a parallel procedure can be active at any process, and  
the group of executing processes is fixed.  
For example, all  
invocations of parallel procedures involve all processes, processes  
are single-threaded, and there are no recursive invocations.  
<P> 
In such a case, a communicator can be statically allocated to each  
procedure.  The static allocation can be done in a preamble, as part  
of initialization code.  If the  
parallel procedures can be organized into libraries, so that only one  
procedure of each library can be concurrently active in each  
processor, then it is sufficient to allocate one communicator per library.

<P>
Calls of parallel procedures are well-nested if a new parallel  
procedure is always invoked in a subset of a group executing the same  
parallel procedure.  Thus, processes that execute the same parallel  
procedure have the same execution stack.  
<P> 
In such a case, a new communicator needs to be dynamically allocated  
for each new invocation of a parallel procedure.  
The allocation is done by the caller.  
A new communicator can be generated by a call to  
 MPI_COMM_DUP, if the callee execution group is identical  
to the caller execution group, or by a call to  
 MPI_COMM_SPLIT if the caller execution group is split into  
several subgroups executing distinct parallel routines.  
The new communicator is passed as an argument to the invoked routine.  
<P> 
The need for generating a new communicator at each invocation can be  
alleviated or avoided altogether in some cases:  If the execution  
group is not split, then one can allocate a stack of communicators in  
a preamble, and next manage the stack in a way that mimics  
the stack of recursive calls.  
<P> 
One can also take advantage of the  
well-ordering property of communication to avoid confusing caller and  
callee communication, even if both use the same communicator.  To do  
so, one needs to abide by the following two rules:  
<ul> 
 
<li>messages sent before a procedure call (or before a return from the  
procedure)  
are also received before the matching call (or return) at the  
receiving end;  
 
<li>messages are always selected by source (no use is made of  
 MPI_ANY_SOURCE).  
</ul>

<P>
In the general case, there may be multiple concurrently active  
invocations of the same parallel procedure within the same group;  
invocations may not be well-nested.  A new communicator needs to be  
created for each invocation.  It is the user's responsibility to make  
sure that, should two distinct parallel procedures be invoked  
concurrently on overlapping sets of processes, then  
communicator creation be properly coordinated.
