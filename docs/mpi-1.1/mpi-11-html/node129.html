The communication pattern of a set of processes can be represented by a  
graph. The nodes stand for the processes, and the edges connect processes that  
communicate with each other.  MPI provides message-passing between any pair  
of processes in a group. There is no requirement for opening a channel  
explicitly. Therefore, a ``missing link'' in the user-defined process graph  
does not prevent the corresponding processes from exchanging messages. It  
means rather that this connection is neglected in the virtual topology. This  
strategy implies  
that the topology gives no convenient way of naming this pathway of  
communication.  Another possible consequence is that an automatic mapping tool  
(if one exists for the runtime environment) will not take account of this edge  
when mapping.  Edges in the communication graph are not weighted, so that  
processes are either simply connected or not connected at all.

[]<em> Rationale.</em>  
<P> 
Experience with similar  
techniques in PARMACS [<a href="node166.html#-Bib5">5</a>,<a href="node166.html#-Bib8">8</a>]  
show that this information is usually sufficient for a good mapping.  
Additionally, a more precise specification is more difficult  
for the user to set up, and it would make the interface  
functions substantially more complicated.  
 (<em> End of rationale.</em>) <BR> 
Specifying the virtual  
topology in terms of a graph is sufficient for all applications. However, in  
many applications the graph structure is regular, and the detailed set-up  
of the graph would be inconvenient for the user and might be less  
efficient at  
run time. A large fraction of all parallel applications use process topologies  
like rings, two- or higher-dimensional grids, or tori. These structures are  
completely defined by the number of dimensions and the numbers of processes in  
each coordinate direction.  Also, the mapping of grids and tori is generally  
an easier problem then that of general graphs.  Thus, it is desirable to  
address these cases explicitly.  
<P> 
Process coordinates in a cartesian structure begin their numbering at <I>0</i>.  
Row-major numbering is always used for the processes in a  
cartesian structure. This means that, for example, the relation  
between group rank and coordinates for four processes in  
a <IMG SRC="img167.gif">
 grid is as follows.<BR>
