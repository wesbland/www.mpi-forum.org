<P>
  
  
<P> 
This section defines the rules for  MPI language binding in general and  
for Fortran 77 and ANSI C in particular.  
Defined here are various object representations,  
as well as the naming conventions used for expressing this  
standard.  
The actual calling sequences are defined elsewhere.  
<P> 
It is expected that any Fortran 90 and C++ implementations  
use the Fortran 77 and ANSI C bindings, respectively.  
Although we consider it premature to define other bindings to  
Fortran 90 and C++, the current bindings are designed to encourage,  
rather than discourage, experimentation with better  
bindings that might be adopted later.  
<P> 
Since the word PARAMETER is a keyword in the Fortran language,  
we use the word ``argument'' to denote the arguments to a  
subroutine. These are normally referred to  
as parameters in C, however, we expect that C programmers will  
understand the word  
``argument'' (which has no specific meaning in C), thus allowing us to avoid  
unnecessary confusion for Fortran programmers.  
<P> 
There are several important language binding  
issues not addressed by this standard.  
This standard does not discuss the interoperability  
of message passing between languages.  
It is fully expected that many implementations will have such features,  
and that such features are a sign of the quality of the implementation.
