<P>
 MPI programs require that library routines that are part of the  
basic language environment (such as <tt>date</tt>  
and <tt>write</tt> in Fortran and <tt>printf</tt> and <tt>malloc</tt> in ANSI  
C) and are executed after <tt>MPI_INIT</tt> and before <tt>MPI_FINALIZE</tt>  
operate independently and that their <em> completion</em> is  
independent of the action of other processes in an  MPI program.  
<P> 
Note that this in no way prevents the creation of library routines that  
provide parallel services whose operation is collective.  However, the  
following program is expected to complete in an ANSI C environment  
regardless of the size of <tt>MPI_COMM_WORLD</tt> (assuming that  
I/O is available at the executing nodes).  
<BR> 
<pre><tt>int rank; 
MPI_Init( argc, argv ); 
MPI_Comm_rank( MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;rank ); 
if (rank == 0) printf( "Starting program\n" ); 
MPI_Finalize(); 
</tt></pre> 
The corresponding Fortran 77 program is also expected to complete.  
<P> 
An example of what is <em> not</em> required is any particular ordering  
of the action of these routines when called by several tasks.  For  
example,  MPI makes neither requirements nor recommendations for the  
output from the following program (again assuming that  
I/O is available at the executing nodes).  
<BR> 
<pre><tt>MPI_Comm_rank( MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;rank ); 
printf( "Output from task rank %d\n", rank ); 
</tt></pre> 
In addition, calls that fail because of resource exhaustion or other  
error are not considered a violation of the requirements here (however,  
they are required to complete, just not to complete successfully).  
<P>
