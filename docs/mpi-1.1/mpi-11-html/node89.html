<P>
The  key features needed to support  
the creation of robust parallel libraries are as follows:  
<ul> 
 
<li>Safe communication space, that guarantees that  
libraries can communicate as they need to, without conflicting with  
communication extraneous to the library,  
 
<li>Group scope for collective operations, that allow  
libraries to avoid unnecessarily synchronizing uninvolved  
processes (potentially running unrelated code),  
 
<li>Abstract process naming to allow libraries to describe  
their communication in terms suitable to their own data  
structures and algorithms,  
 
<li>The ability to ``adorn'' a set of communicating processes with  
additional user-defined attributes, such as extra collective  
operations.  This mechanism should provide a means for the  
user or library writer effectively to extend a message-passing  
notation.  
</ul> 
<BR> 
In addition, a unified mechanism or object is needed for conveniently denoting  
communication context, the group of communicating processes, to house abstract  
process naming, and to store adornments.
