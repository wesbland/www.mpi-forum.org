<P>
When a caller passes a communicator (that contains a context and  
group) to a callee, that communicator must be free of side effects  
throughout execution of the subprogram: there should be no active  
operations on that communicator that might involve the process.  
This provides one  
model in which libraries can be written, and work ``safely.''  For  
libraries so designated, the callee has permission to do whatever  
communication it likes with the communicator, and under the above  
guarantee knows that no other communications will interfere. Since we  
permit good implementations to create new communicators without  
synchronization (such as by preallocated contexts on communicators),  
this does not impose a significant overhead.  
<P> 
This form of safety is analogous to other common computer-science  
usages, such as passing a descriptor of an array to a library routine.  
The library routine has every right to expect such a descriptor to  
be valid and modifiable.  
<P>
