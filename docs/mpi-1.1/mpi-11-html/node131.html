<P>
  
The functions  MPI_GRAPH_CREATE and  MPI_CART_CREATE are used  
to create general (graph) virtual topologies and cartesian topologies, respectively.  
These topology creation functions are collective.  As with other collective  
calls, the program must be written to work correctly, whether the call  
synchronizes or not.  
<P> 
The topology creation functions take as input an existing communicator  
 comm_old,  
which defines the set of processes on which the topology is to be  
mapped. A new communicator  comm_topol is created that carries  
the topological structure as cached information  
(see Chapter <a href="node87.html#Node87">Groups, Contexts, and Communicators
</a>). In analogy to function  
 MPI_COMM_CREATE, no cached information propagates from  
 comm_old to  comm_topol.  
<P> 
 MPI_CART_CREATE can be used to describe cartesian structures of  
arbitrary dimension. For each coordinate direction one specifies whether the  
process structure is periodic or not.  
Note that an <I>n</i>-dimensional hypercube is  
an <I>n</i>-dimensional torus with 2 processes per coordinate direction. Thus,  
special support for hypercube structures is not necessary.  The local  
auxiliary function  MPI_DIMS_CREATE can be used to compute a balanced  
distribution of processes among a given number of dimensions.  
<P> 
 
<BR> 
[]<em> Rationale.</em>  
Similar functions are contained in  
EXPRESS [<a href="node166.html#-Bib22">22</a>] and PARMACS.   (<em> End of rationale.</em>) <BR> 
The function  MPI_TOPO_TEST can be used to inquire about the  
topology associated with a communicator.  The topological information can be  
extracted from the communicator using the functions  
 MPI_GRAPHDIMS_GET and  MPI_GRAPH_GET, for general  
graphs, and  MPI_CARTDIM_GET and  MPI_CART_GET, for  
cartesian topologies.  Several additional functions are provided to manipulate  
cartesian topologies: the functions  MPI_CART_RANK and  
 MPI_CART_COORDS translate cartesian coordinates into a group rank,  
and vice-versa; the function  MPI_CART_SUB can be used to extract a  
cartesian subspace (analogous to  MPI_COMM_SPLIT).  The function  
 MPI_CART_SHIFT provides the information needed to communicate with  
neighbors in a cartesian dimension.  The two functions  
<BR>  
 MPI_GRAPH_NEIGHBORS_COUNT and  MPI_GRAPH_NEIGHBORS can  
be used to extract the neighbors of a node in a graph.  The function  
 MPI_CART_SUB is collective over the input communicator's group;  
all other functions are local.  
<P> 
Two additional functions,  MPI_GRAPH_MAP and  
 MPI_CART_MAP are presented in the last section.  In general these  
functions are not called by the user directly.  However, together with the  
communicator manipulation functions presented in Chapter <a href="node87.html#Node87">Groups, Contexts, and Communicators
</a>,  
they are sufficient to implement all other topology functions.  
Section <a href="node139.html#Node139">Low-level topology functions
</a> outlines such an implementation.
