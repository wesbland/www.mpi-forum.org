<P>
A <b> context</b> is a property of communicators (defined next) that allows  
partitioning of the communication space.  A message sent in one context cannot  
be received in another context.  Furthermore, where permitted, collective  
operations are independent of pending point-to-point operations.  
Contexts are not explicit  MPI objects; they appear only as part of  
the realization of communicators (below).  
<P> 
 
<BR> 
<em> Advice  
        to implementors.</em>  
<P> 
Distinct communicators in the same process have distinct contexts.  A context  
is essentially a system-managed tag (or tags) needed to make a communicator  
safe for point-to-point and  MPI-defined collective communication.  Safety  
means that collective and point-to-point communication within one  
communicator do not interfere, and that communication over distinct  
communicators don't interfere.  
<P> 
A possible implementation for a context is as a supplemental tag attached  
to messages on send and matched on receive.  Each intra-communicator stores  
the value of its two tags (one for point-to-point and one for  
collective communication).  
Communicator-generating functions use a collective  
communication to agree on a new group-wide unique context.  
<P> 
Analogously, in  
inter-communication,   
two context tags are stored per communicator, one used by  
group A to send and group B to receive, and a second used by group B to  
send and for group A to receive.  
<P> 
Since contexts are not explicit objects, other  
implementations are also possible.
