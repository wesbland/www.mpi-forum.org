<P>
The standard does not specify:  
<P> 
<ul> 
     
<li>Operations that require more operating system support than is currently  
          standard; for example, interrupt-driven receives, remote execution,  
          or active messages,     
<li>Program construction tools,  
     
<li>Debugging facilities.  
</ul> 
<BR> 
There are many features that have been considered and  
not included in this standard. This happened for   
a number of reasons, one of which is the time constraint  
that was self-imposed in finishing the standard.  
Features that are not included can always be offered as extensions  
by specific  
implementations.  
Perhaps future versions of  MPI will address some of these issues.
