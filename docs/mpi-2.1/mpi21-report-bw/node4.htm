MPI (Message-Passing Interface) is a <em> message-passing library  
  interface specification</em>.  All parts of this definition are  
significant.  MPI addresses primarily the message-passing parallel  
programming model, in which data is moved from the address space of  
one process to that of another process through cooperative operations  
on each process.  (Extensions to the ``classical'' message-passing model  
are provided in collective operations, remote-memory access  
operations, dynamic process creation, and parallel I/O.)  MPI is a  
<em> specification</em>, not an implementation; there are multiple  
implementations of MPI.  This specification is for a <em> library  
  interface</em>; MPI is not a language, and all MPI operations are  
expressed as functions, subroutines, or methods, according to the  
appropriate language bindings, which for C, C++, Fortran-77, and  
Fortran-95, are part of the MPI standard.  The standard has been  
defined through an open process by a community of parallel computing  
vendors, computer scientists, and application developers.  The next  
few sections provide an overview of the history of MPI's development.    
<P> 
The main advantages of establishing a message-passing standard are portability  
and ease of use. In a distributed memory communication environment in which  
the higher level routines and/or abstractions are   
built   
upon lower level  
message-passing routines the benefits of standardization are particularly  
apparent. Furthermore, the definition of a message-passing standard, such  
as that proposed here, provides vendors with a clearly defined base set of  
routines that they can implement efficiently, or in some cases provide  
hardware support for, thereby enhancing scalability.  
<P> 
The goal of the Message-Passing Interface simply stated is to  
develop a widely used  
standard for writing message-passing programs.  
As such the interface should  
establish a practical, portable, efficient, and flexible standard for message  
passing.  
<P> 
A complete list of goals follows.  
<P> 
<ul> 
 
<li>Design an application programming interface (not necessarily for compilers  
or a system implementation library).  
<P> 
 
<li>Allow efficient communication: Avoid memory-to-memory copying,  
allow overlap of computation and communication, and offload to communication  
co-processor, where available.  
<P> 
 
<li>Allow for implementations that can be used in a heterogeneous environment.  
<P> 
 
<li>Allow convenient   
C, C++, Fortran-77, and Fortran-95   
bindings for the interface.  
<P> 
 
<li>Assume a reliable communication interface:  
the user need not cope with communication failures.  
Such failures are dealt with by the underlying communication subsystem.  
<P> 
  
  
 
<li>Define an interface that can be implemented on many  
vendor's platforms, with no significant changes in the underlying  
communication and system software.  
<P> 
 
<li>Semantics of the interface should be language independent.  
<P> 
 
<li>The interface should be designed to allow for thread safety.  
</ul>
