<P>
The attractiveness of the message-passing paradigm at least partially  
stems from its wide portability.  Programs expressed this way may run  
on distributed-memory  
multiprocessors, networks of workstations, and combinations of all of these.  
In addition, shared-memory implementations,  
including those for multi-core processors and hybrid   
architectures,  
  
are possible.  
The paradigm will not be made obsolete by architectures combining the shared-  
and distributed-memory views, or by increases in network speeds.  It thus  
should be both possible and useful to implement this standard on a great  
variety of machines, including those ``machines'' consisting of collections of  
other machines, parallel or not, connected by a communication network.  
<P> 
The interface is suitable for use by fully general MIMD programs, as well as  
those written in the more restricted style of  
SPMD.  
 MPI provides many features intended to improve performance on  
scalable parallel computers with  
specialized interprocessor communication  
hardware.  Thus, we expect that native, high-performance  
implementations of  MPI will be provided on such machines.  At the  
same time, implementations of  MPI on top of standard Unix  
interprocessor communication protocols will provide portability to  
workstation clusters and heterogenous networks of workstations.
