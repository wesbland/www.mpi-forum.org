<P>
  
The following is a list of the remaining chapters in this document, along with  
a brief description of each.  
  
<ul> 
 
<li>Chapter <a href="node13.htm#Node13">MPI Terms and Conventions 
</a>,  MPI Terms and Conventions,  
explains notational terms and conventions used  
throughout the  MPI document.  
 
<li>Chapter <a href="node38.htm#Node38">Point-to-Point Communication 
</a>,  Point to Point Communication,  
defines the basic, pairwise communication subset of  MPI.    
<em> Send</em>  
and <em> receive</em> are found here, along with many associated functions  
designed to make basic communication powerful and efficient.  
 
<li>Chapter <a href="node66.htm#Node66">Datatypes 
</a>,  Datatypes, defines a method to describe any data layout,  
e.g., an array of structures in the memory,   
which can be used as message send or receive buffer.  
 
<li>Chapter <a href="node84.htm#Node84">Collective Communication 
</a>,  Collective Communications, defines  
process-group collective communication operations.  Well known  
examples of this are barrier and broadcast over a group of processes (not  
necessarily all the processes).  
With  MPI-2, the semantics of collective   
communication  
was extended  
to include intercommunicators.  
It also adds   
two new collective operations.  
 
<li>Chapter <a href="node114.htm#Node114">Groups, Contexts, Communicators, and Caching 
</a>,  Groups, Contexts,   
Communicators, and Caching,  
shows how groups of processes are formed and manipulated, how unique  
communication contexts are obtained, and how the two are bound together  
into a <em> communicator</em>.  
 
<li>Chapter <a href="node159.htm#Node159">Process Topologies 
</a>,  Process Topologies, explains a set  
of utility functions meant to assist in the mapping of process  
groups (a linearly ordered set) to richer topological structures  
such as multi-dimensional grids.  
 
<li>Chapter <a href="node173.htm#Node173">MPI Environmental Management 
</a>,  MPI Environmental Management, explains  
how the programmer can manage and make inquiries of the current  MPI environment.  
These functions are needed for the writing of correct, robust programs,  
and are especially important for the construction of highly-portable   
message-passing programs.  
</ul> 
<BR> 
<ul> 
 
<li>Chapter <a href="node194.htm#Node194">The  Info Object 
</a>,  The Info Object, defines an opaque object, that is used as input of several  MPI routines.  
 
<li>Chapter <a href="node195.htm#Node195">Process Creation and Management 
</a>,  Process Creation and Management,   
defines   
routines that allow for creation of processes.  
 
<li>Chapter <a href="node223.htm#Node223">One-Sided Communications 
</a>,  One-Sided Communications, defines  
communication routines that can be completed by a single process.  These include  
shared-memory operations (put/get) and remote accumulate operations.  
 
<li>Chapter <a href="node247.htm#Node247">External Interfaces 
</a>,  External Interfaces,  
defines routines designed to allow developers to layer on  
top of  MPI.  This includes generalized requests, routines that  
decode  MPI opaque objects, and threads.  
 
<li>Chapter <a href="node256.htm#Node256">I/O 
</a>,  I/O, defines   
 MPI   
support for parallel I/O.  
 
<li>Chapter <a href="node307.htm#Node307">Profiling Interface 
</a>,  Profiling Interface, explains a simple   
name-shifting convention that any  MPI implementation must support.  
One motivation for this is the ability to put performance profiling  
calls into  MPI without the need for access to the  MPI source code.  The  
name shift is merely an interface, it says nothing about how the actual  
profiling should be done and in fact, the name shift can   
be useful for other purposes.  
 
<li>Chapter <a href="node321.htm#Node321">Deprecated Functions 
</a>,  Deprecated Functions, describes routines that   
are kept for reference. However usage of these functions is discouraged, as  
they may be deleted in future versions of the standard.  
 
<li>Chapter <a href="node323.htm#Node323">Language Bindings 
</a>,   
 Language Bindings, describes   
the C++ binding, discusses Fortran issues,   
and describes language interoperability aspects between   
C, C++, and Fortran.  
</ul> 
<BR> 
  
The Appendices are:  
<P> 
<ul> 
 
<li>Annex <a href="node367.htm#Node367">Language Bindings Summary 
</a>,  
 Language Bindings Summary,  
gives specific syntax in   
C, C++, and Fortran,  
for all  MPI functions,   
constants, and types.  
 
<li>Annex <a href="node425.htm#Node425">Change-Log 
</a>,   
 Change-Log, summarizes major changes since the previous  
version of the standard.  
 
<li>Several  Index pages are showing the locations of examples, constants and predefined handles,  
callback routines' prototypes, and all  MPI functions.   
</ul> 
<BR> 
  
  
 MPI   
provides various interfaces to facilitate interoperability  
  of distinct   MPI implementations.  Among these are the canonical  
  
  data representation for  MPI I/O and for  MPI_PACK_EXTERNAL and  
   MPI_UNPACK_EXTERNAL.  
  
The definition of an actual binding of these interfaces that will  
enable interoperability is outside the scope of this document.  
<P> 
  
<P> 
A separate document consists of ideas that were discussed in the  
 MPI Forum and deemed to have value, but are not included in the  MPI  
Standard.  They are part of the ``Journal of Development'' (JOD), lest good ideas be  
lost and in order to provide a starting point for further work.    
  
The chapters in the JOD are  
<P> 
<ul> 
  
 
<li>Chapter 2,  Spawning Independent Processes,  
  includes some elements of dynamic process management, in particular  
  management of processes with which the spawning processes do not intend to  
  communicate, that the Forum discussed at length but ultimately decided not  
  to include in the  MPI Standard.  
 
<li>Chapter 3,  Threads and MPI, describes some  
  of the expected  
  interaction between an  MPI implementation and a thread library in a  
  multi-threaded environment.  
  
 
<li>Chapter 4,  Communicator ID, describes an  
  approach to providing identifiers for communicators.  
  
 
<li>Chapter 5,  Miscellany, discusses  
  Miscellaneous topics in the  MPI JOD, in particular single-copy routines for  
  use in shared-memory environments and new datatype constructors.  
 
<li>Chapter 6,  Toward a Full Fortran 90 Interface,  
  describes an approach to providing a more elaborate Fortran 90 interface.  
  
 
<li>Chapter 7,  Split Collective  
    Communication, describes a specification for certain non-blocking  
  collective operations.  
 
<li>Chapter 8,  Real-Time  MPI, discusses  MPI support for  
real time processing.
