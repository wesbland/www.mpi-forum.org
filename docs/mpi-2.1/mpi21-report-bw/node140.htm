<P>
  
<P> 
This section introduces four blocking inter-communicator operations.  
 MPI_INTERCOMM_CREATE is used to bindtwo intra-communicators into an inter-communicator; the function  
 MPI_INTERCOMM_MERGE creates an intra-communicator by  
merging the local and remote groups of an inter-communicator.  The  
functions <BR> MPI_COMM_DUP and  
<BR> MPI_COMM_FREE, introduced previously,  
duplicate and free an inter-communicator, respectively.  
<P> 
Overlap of local and remote groups that are bound into an  
inter-communicator is prohibited.  If there is overlap, then the  
program is erroneous and is likely to deadlock.  (If a process is  
multithreaded, and  MPI calls block only a thread, rather than a  
process, then ``dual membership'' can be supported.  It is then the  
user's responsibility to make sure that calls on behalf of the two  
``roles'' of a process are executed by two independent threads.)  
<P> 
The function  MPI_INTERCOMM_CREATE can be used to create an  
inter-communicator from two existing intra-communicators, in the following  
situation: At least one selected member from each group (the ``group  
leader'') has the ability to communicate with the selected member from  
the other group; that is, a ``peer'' communicator exists to which both  
leaders belong, and each leader knows the rank of the other leader in  
this peer communicator.  
Furthermore, members of each group know the rank of their leader.  
<P> 
Construction of an inter-communicator from two intra-communicators requires  
separate collective operations in the local group and in the remote group, as  
well as a point-to-point communication between a process in the local group  
and a process in the remote group.  
<P> 
In standard  MPI implementations (with static process allocation  
at initialization), the  MPI_COMM_WORLD  
communicator (or preferably a dedicated duplicate thereof)  
can be this peer communicator.    
For applications that have used spawn or join, it may be necessary  
to first create an intracommunicator to be used as peer.  
  
The application topology functions described in Chapter <a href="node159.htm#Node159">Process Topologies 
</a> do  
not apply to inter-communicators.  Users that require this capability should  
utilize  MPI_INTERCOMM_MERGE to build an intra-communicator, then  
apply the graph or cartesian topology capabilities to that intra-communicator,  
creating an appropriate topology-oriented intra-communicator.  Alternatively,  
it may be reasonable to devise one's own application topology mechanisms for  
this case, without loss of generality.  
<P>

 This call creates an inter-communicator.  It is collective  
over the union of the local and remote groups.  Processes should  
provide identical  local_comm and  local_leader  
arguments within each group.  
Wildcards are not permitted for  
 remote_leader, local_leader, and  tag.  
<P> 
This call uses point-to-point communication with communicator  
 peer_comm, and with tag  tag between the leaders.  
Thus, care must be taken that there be no pending communication on  
 peer_comm that could interfere with this communication.  
<P> 
 
<BR> 
<em> Advice to users.</em>  
<P> 
We recommend using a dedicated peer communicator, such as a duplicate  
of MPI_COMM_WORLD, to avoid trouble with peer communicators.

 This  
function creates an intra-communicator from the union of  
the two groups that are associated with  intercomm.  
All processes  should provide the same  
 high value within each of the two groups.  If processes in one group  
provided the value  high = false and processes in the other group  
provided the value  high = true then the union orders the ``low'' group  
before the ``high'' group.  If all processes provided the same  high  
argument then the order of the union is arbitrary.  
This call is blocking and collective within the union of  
the two groups.  
<P> 
  
The error handler on the new intercommunicator in each process is inherited  
from the communicator that contributes the local group.  Note that this can  
result in different processes in the same communicator having different error  
handlers.  
<P> 
 
<BR> 
<em> Advice  
        to implementors.</em>  
 The implementation of  
 MPI_INTERCOMM_MERGE,  
<BR>  
 MPI_COMM_FREE and  MPI_COMM_DUP are  
similar to the implementation of <BR>  
 MPI_INTERCOMM_CREATE, except  
that contexts private to the input inter-communicator  
are used for  
communication between group leaders rather than contexts inside a  
bridge communicator.   (<em> End of advice to implementors.</em>) <BR>
