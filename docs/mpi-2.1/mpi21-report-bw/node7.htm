After the release of  MPI-2.0, the  MPI Forum kept working on  
errata and clarifications for both standard documents ( MPI-1.1 and  MPI-2.0).  
The short document ``Errata for  MPI-1.1'' was released October 12, 1998.  
On   
July 5, 2001, a first ballot of errata and clarifications for  MPI-2.0  
was released, and a second ballot was voted on May 22, 2002.  
Both votes were done   
electronically.   
Both ballots were combined into one document:  
``Errata for  MPI-2'', May 15, 2002.  
This errata process was then interrupted, but the   
Forum and its e-mail reflectors kept working   
on new requests for clarification.  
 <P> 
Restarting regular work of the  MPI Forum was initiated in  
three meetings,   
at EuroPVM/MPI'06 in Bonn, at EuroPVM/MPI'07 in Paris, and   
at SC'07 in Reno.   
In December 2007,   
a steering committee started the  
organization of new  MPI Forum meetings at regular 8-weeks intervals.   
At the January 14-16, 2008   
meeting in Chicago, the MPI Forum decided to combine  
the existing and future  MPI documents to one single document for  
each version of the  MPI standard.  
For technical and historical reasons, this series was started with  MPI-1.3.  
Additional Ballots 3 and 4   
solved  
old questions from the   
errata list started in 1995   
up to   
new questions from the last years.  
After all documents ( MPI-1.1,  MPI-2, Errata for  MPI-1.1 (Oct. 12, 1998),  
and  MPI-2.1 Ballots 1-4) were combined into one draft document,  
for each chapter, a chapter author and review team were defined.  
They cleaned up the document to achieve a consistent  MPI-2.1 document.  
The  
final  MPI-2.1 standard document   
was  
finished in June 2008, and finally released with a second vote  
in September 2008 in the meeting at Dublin,   
just  
before EuroPVM/MPI'08.   
The major work of the current  MPI Forum is the preparation of  MPI-3.
