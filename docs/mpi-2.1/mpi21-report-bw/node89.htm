<P>
All processes in both groups identified by the intercommunicator must call  
the collective routine.  In addition, processes in the same group must call  
the routine with matching arguments.  
<P> 
Note that the ``in place'' option for intracommunicators does not apply to  
intercommunicators since in the intercommunicator case there is no  
communication from a process to itself.  
<P> 
For intercommunicator collective communication, if  
the  
operation is rooted (e.g., broadcast, gather, scatter), then the transfer is  
unidirectional.  
The direction of the transfer is indicated  
by a special value of the root argument.  
  
In this case, for the group containing the root process, all processes in  
the group must call the routine using a special argument for the root.  
For this, the   
root process uses the special root value  MPI_ROOT; all other  
processes   
in the same group as the root use  MPI_PROC_NULL.  
All processes in the other group (the group that  
is the remote group relative to the root process) must call the collective  
routine and provide the rank of the root.  
  
If the operation is unrooted (e.g., alltoall), then the  
transfer is bidirectional.

<em> Rationale.</em>  
<P> 
Rooted operations are unidirectional by nature, and there is a clear  
way of specifying direction.  Non-rooted operations, such as  
all-to-all, will often occur as part of an exchange, where it makes  
sense to communicate in both  directions at once.  
 (<em> End of rationale.</em>) <BR>
