<P>
The attractiveness of the message-passing paradigm at least partially  
stems from its wide portability.  Programs expressed this way may run  
on distributed-memory  
multiprocessors, networks of workstations, and combinations of all of these.  
In addition, shared-memory implementations,  
including those for multi-core processors and hybrid   
architectures,  
  
are possible.  
The paradigm will not be made obsolete by architectures combining the shared-  
and distributed-memory views, or by increases in network speeds.  It thus  
should be both possible and useful to implement this standard on a great  
variety of machines, including those ``machines'' consisting of collections of  
other machines, parallel or not, connected by a communication network.  
<P> 
The interface is suitable for use by fully general MIMD programs, as well as  
those written in the more restricted style of  
SPMD.  
<font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> provides many features intended to improve performance on  
scalable parallel computers with  
specialized interprocessor communication  
hardware.  Thus, we expect that native, high-performance  
implementations of <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> will be provided on such machines.  At the  
same time, implementations of <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> on top of standard Unix  
interprocessor communication protocols will provide portability to  
workstation clusters and heterogenous networks of workstations.
